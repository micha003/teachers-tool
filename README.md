# teachers-tool

_a simple tool for teachers in the terminal ;)_

- a GUI will be added in version **2.0**
- versions **1.x** will be in console
- the **main**-branch is the branch with a stable version of the app

# Installation guide

1. Make sure, you have **PyInstaller** or **auto-py-to-exe**, because you need it 
   for converting to .exe-file

### How to install PyInstaller or auto-py-to-exe

- Make sure, that you have pip already installed
- console: `pip install PyInstaller` or `pip install auto-py-to-exe`

I recommend the auto-py-to-exe, but if you want to use PyInstaller (which is only working in the console)
is it also okay.

### Convert .py to .exe

2. You have to move to the directory of the **auto-py-to-exe.exe** file (`cd`) and execute the file <br>
with `.\auto-py-to-exe.exe`

_Note: You have to add only the main-files (.py) and not more! That means only the files in the src-directory._
